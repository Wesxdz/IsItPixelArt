How to mass download pixel art images?
Need to also gather non pixel art images... but can probably use a standard ML set of images for that...
Wikipedia all images? (Obviously wikipedia contains some pixel art...)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research


Ideas:
Download images from tweets with #pixelart

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx

Download sprite batches from manually selected urls of https://www.spriters-resource.com/
Which urls have pixel art
Tried https://add0n.com/save-images.html?version=0.9.0&type=install but need control over which classes are downloaded, 
otherwise can't automate and get non-pixel art images
Download all images for platforms: NES/Game Boy Advance

Which ML framework to use for a simple classifier?
Something with minimal dependencies that can be called by C

Maybe consider http://pixeljoint.com/ too?


Data collection finished

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
sudo ln -sfn /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

Manually cleanup data
rm 4465.png

rm pixeljoint/treescene.png
(it was actually a bmp)... wtf
