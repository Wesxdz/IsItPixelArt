## Inspiration

Modern software almost universally uses [bilinear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_gallery_of_image_scaling_algorithms) scaling [by default](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering): this algorithmic bias adversely affects the perception of pixel art. From search engines and game engines to encrypted messengers and social media monoliths, our world needs a more intelligent approach to scaling images.

An open source model for classifying pixel art would
* Make viewing, sharing, and manipulating low-res content more accessible
* Improve tools via contextually aware default settings or actions

I've collected and annotated a high quality dataset of CC0 pixel art and prototyped a neural network in PyTorch with this functionality. Although classification accuracy is not production-ready, my hope is that this project provides a basis for further iteration by
* Establishing a dataset
* Sharing problematic edge cases
* Indicating viable pathways to reach increased accuracy

## What is [pixel art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art)?
I'm not sure, but I think [we'll know it when we see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it).

Let's assume for now that any content <i>created natively by hand or procedural algorithm</i> bounded within some arbitrarily low resolution square grid is ipso facto pixel art.

Some of the earliest non pixel art games were created for [Nintendo 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64), which has a resolution of 320Ã—240. Therefore the prior platform, [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) at 256x240 likely approaches one perception classifier.

#### Axioms
* Low resolution images are not necessarily pixel art
* High resolution images can be pixel art, there is no upper limit
* 3D content can be pixel art
* What is considered pixel art may change over time in response to
    * new rendering techniques applied to retro artstyles
    * adoption of sensory devices that innovate in resolution, display qualia, or interaction mechanisms


#### Data
When I started this project, there were no [open datasets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research) available for machine learning on pixel art images.
How to collect a dataset of pixel art from the internet?

Manually cleanup data
* Mislabeled or unrelated data
* Redundancy (animations exported as series of individual images)
* False type indications (ie bmp named image.jpeg)
* Need an approach for animated images (using just the first frame is not viable, training on multiple frames per image complicates tensors)

[How to load a custom dataset in Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html)
*Classifying pixel art may require distinct data augmentation approaches such as detecting whether input images are nearest neighbor upscaled.*

## Challenges

One of the major obstacles to IsItPixelArt is that the scope of potential training data is much greater and more ambiguous than other image classification tasks.

Edge cases include
* Pixel art created in voxel games like Minecraft
* Upscaled pixel art composed together with non-pixel art textures such as in memes, marketing materials, and post-processing effects. More broadly some images consist of a dynamic mix, often this is expressed in UI. [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) is a anomalous example of a sprite editor which also renders its UI as pixel art.
* Photos of pixel art subtextures on surfaces including screens, stickers, and shirts; or composed of a material form like beads, LEGOs, etc...
* Non pixel art images scaled down with nearest neighbor
* Blurry, low-quality, or watermarked pixel art
* Non-standard scaling input like [Hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel-art_scaling_algorithms)

Although I originally considered IsItPixelArt a binary classification problem, this training approach was difficult because it required my dataset to label 'many non-pixel-art images'. I used random images from Wikipedia as a benchmark for this.
